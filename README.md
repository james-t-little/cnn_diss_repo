Analysed deep learning architectures and their proficiency at image segmentation on satellite image data to increase spatial analysis and residential property optimisation. Proposed a novel parcel boundary segmentation dataset sourcing 3,888 image segmentation pairs. Achieved a classification accuracy of 90.2% utilising the U-Net (encoder-decoder) architecture whilst overcoming complex issues caused by image occlusion and ambiguous visual stimuli.
